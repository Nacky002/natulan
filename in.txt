Once I arrived in Japan, I didn’t have much of an opportunity to do much cooking due to living in an apartment with my wife’s mother and sister. Once we finally moved out into a house of our own, I started to cook again, but had trouble sourcing ingredients for western style recipes (I’m not good at cooking Japanese food). Eventually, I ended up finding a few places that had the ingredients I needed, which was a relief as I was missing western food, but in Japan it is pretty expensive to purchase. It eing expensive didn’t deter my want to start cooking again.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping traded barbs Nov. 14 over Taiwan, with Xi stressing that the question of the self-ruled island is “the first red line that must not be crossed,” but agreed to develop “principles” to manage their intensifying competition.
In their first in-person meeting, which took place in Indonesia’s Bali, Biden expressed objections to China’s “coercive and increasingly aggressive actions” toward Taiwan, saying they undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and jeopardize global prosperity, according to the White House.
